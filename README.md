# MachineLearning_Python
Machine learning practice code.

This repository is the source code for popular Machine learning(both supervised and unsupervised learning), 
Deep learning and Natural language processing algorithms. All the algorithms here are implemented in python using the various packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, ggplot, scikit-learn, tensorflow, etc., The dataset used for the algorithm is found in the corresponding folders which are public, please feel free to use.
